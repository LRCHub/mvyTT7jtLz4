Feel the adrenalin chasing through your veins
Gotta love the attention
I wanna feel the energy rising
I wanna feel this bass drum pounding
Through your skin, you take to the night
Like thunder and lightning
Let's own this night
Just you and me boy
Let me hear you scream

Heyyyy
Heyyyy

I can't help but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard,
Right at your feet

Take take take me anywhere you want me
I wanna feel you play
With my heart
Grasp anything you want
I love to feel this pain

Heyyyy
Ohhhh

I can't help but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard,
Right at your feet

I can't help but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard,
Right at your feet

I can't help but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard,
Right at your feet

I can't help but feel yeaa
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard at your feet
